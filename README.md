## Improvements

-  Ideally this file should be parsed using a parsing library, by creating structs with the appropriate grammar.

- Convert IP function could be formalized to output better errors, and carry the IP and port in a struct, instead of
just using a string. Variable naming can be improved inside helper functions.

- Numbers in the convertIP and convertPort function could be written as constants
